  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) methods for constructing structural models of proteins on the basis of their sequence are having a transformative effect in biomolecular sciences. The AlphaFold protein structure database makes available hundreds of thousands of protein structures. However, all these structures lack cofactors essential for their structural integrity and molecular function (e.g. hemoglobin lacks a bound heme), key ions essential for structural integrity (e.g. zinc-finger motifs) or catalysis (e.g. Ca2+ or Zn2+ in metalloproteases), and ligands that are important for biological function (e.g. kinase structures lack ADP or ATP). Here, we present AlphaFill, an algorithm based on sequence and structure similarity, to ``transplant'' such ``missing'' small molecules and ions from experimentally determined structures to predicted protein models. These publicly available structural annotations are mapped to predicted protein models, to help scientists interpret biological function and design experiments.},

Herein, we present `The Protein Imager', a lightweight, powerful and easy-to-use interface as a next-gen online molecular viewer. Furthermore, the interface is linked to an automated server-side rendering system able to generate publication-quality molecular illustrations. The Protein Imager interface has been designed for easy usage for beginners and experts in the field alike. The interface allows the preparation of very complex molecular views maintaining a high level of responsiveness even on mobile devices.                                         Availability and implementation               The Protein Imager interface is freely available online at https://3dproteinimaging.com/protein-imager.
